# 032_Grid-Exercise-3-3

A newspaper made with mainly CSS grid and some flexbox: https://timsch3.github.io/032_Grid-Exercise-3-3/

The template.png is from assignment.

This was a great exercise to get used to CSS grid. Also found out about old style fonts and how to use `font-variant-numeric` to keep numbers the same height as capitalized letters.
